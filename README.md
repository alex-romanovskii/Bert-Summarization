# Bert-Summarization

## This code based on [Bert Extractive Summarizer](https://github.com/dmmiller612/bert-extractive-summarizer), but it was important for me to get not the summary itself, but the weight for each sentence. 

The result is presented in the form of a pandas DataFrame, which contains information about the sentence index, its weight (the higher the weight, the more important the sentence), the number of the cluster to which it belongs and the sentence itself.  
Weight normalization was performed using MinMaxScaller from SKlearn. Since initially the weights represent the distance to the center of the cluster, that is, the smaller the distance, the more important the sentence. I subtract 1from each weights and then get absolute value. Thus, the smallest number will become the largest. It is more convenient to interpret such data.  

### Example

```
from summarizer import Summarizer

sample_doc = '''Put here any text'''
model = Summarizer()
result = model(sample_doc, min_length=1,max_length=600,ratio=0.1)
//changing the ratio changes the number of clusters
model.df

```
